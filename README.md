# A checkbox column for Thunderbird

Adds a custom column to Thunderbird's messages list (thread tree), making it easier to select multiple messages on devices with a touchscreen display. 
You can toggle the selection status of a row by clicking/tapping the :white_circle:. By default, the row height is increased to reduce potential tapping errors.
This can be turned off in the extension's settings.

## Installation

In Thunderbird, go to Tools → Add-ons → Extensions and search for "Checkbox" in the search box in the upper right-hand corner. In the result list, click Install on the right side.

You can also download the add-on from its [detail page at Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/checkbox-column/) and then install using the [instructions here](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Extensions_(Thunderbird)).
